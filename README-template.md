## Overview
This is a landing page of Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum that I built. It incorporates bright colors, and is responsive for both the mobile and web.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
To make the landing page come out as desired, I made sure to build the mobile before the web.

Furthermore, I ensured to make use of better font size, so that the writings would be legible to all.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
First off, I learnt to be self sufficient as a developer. This is key for any developer, and I am glad I took this path.

Also, for my hml, I learnt how to make use of DIVs better
```html
<div>Some HTML code I'm proud of</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  br{
    display: none;
  }
  img:nth-child(2){
        display: none;
        align-content: center;
       
    }
}
```
The reason for which I am proud of this css is that it helped my creativity in adding a better response to the landing page.

### Continued development
I would develop on making more responsive websites, and incorporate js to my project next. It would not be easy, but I would give my all to make it work. 

### Useful resources
